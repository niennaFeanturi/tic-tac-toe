The most challenging part of this assignment was learning a new language and web dev techniques that I hadn't encountered before. I didn't entirely succeed, but I 
used online resources to handle this challenge. 
While all the AWS resources, created from my scripts, are individually functional, I struggled to completely implement a cli that handled all of the interactions
necessary for the game to function. My interface can create games and register and login users, but does not functionally perform the game moves or notify 
users via email.
